# 3D Game Shaders For Beginners

## Running The Demo

After you've built the example code, you can now run the executable or demo.

```bash
./3d-game-shaders-for-beginners
```

Here's how you run it on Linux or Mac.

```bash
3d-game-shaders-for-beginners.exe
```

Here's how you run it on Windows.

### Demo Controls

The demo comes with both keyboard and mouse controls to move the camera around,
toggle on and off the different effects,
adjust the fog,
and view the various different framebuffer textures.

#### Mouse

You can rotate the scene around by holding down the <kbd>Left Mouse</kbd> button and dragging.
Hold down the <kbd>Right Mouse</kbd> button and drag to move up, down, left, and/or right.
To zoom in, roll the <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> forward.
To zoom out, roll the <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> backward.

#### Keyboard

- <kbd>w</kbd> to rotate the scene down.
- <kbd>a</kbd> to rotate the scene clockwise.
- <kbd>s</kbd> to rotate the scene up.
- <kbd>d</kbd> to rotate the scene counterclockwise.
- <kbd>z</kbd> to zoom in to the scene.
- <kbd>x</kbd> to zoom out of the scene.
- <kbd>⬅</kbd> to move left.
- <kbd>➡</kbd> to move right.
- <kbd>⬆</kbd> to move up.
- <kbd>⬇</kbd> to move down.

<br>

- <kbd>y</kbd> to toggle SSAO.
- <kbd>u</kbd> to toggle outlining.
- <kbd>i</kbd> to toggle bloom.
- <kbd>o</kbd> to toggle normal mapping.
- <kbd>p</kbd> to toggle fog.
- <kbd>h</kbd> to toggle depth of field.
- <kbd>j</kbd> to toggle posterization.
- <kbd>k</kbd> to toggle pixelization.
- <kbd>l</kbd> to toggle sharpen.
- <kbd>n</kbd> to toggle film grain.
- <kbd>m</kbd> to toggle screen space reflection.
- <kbd>,</kbd> to toggle screen space refraction.
- <kbd>.</kbd> to toggle flow mapping.
- <kbd>Delete</kbd> to toggle the sound.

<br>

- <kbd>r</kbd> to reset the scene.

<br>

- <kbd>\[</kbd> to increase the fog near distance.
- <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>\[</kbd> to decrease the fog near distance.
- <kbd>]</kbd> to increase the fog far distance.
- <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd> to decrease the fog far distance.

<br>

- <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> to decrease the amount of foam.
- <kbd>-</kbd> to increase the amount of foam.

<br>

- <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>=</kbd> to decrease the relative index of refraction.
- <kbd>=</kbd> to increase the relative index of refraction.

<br>

- <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move forward through the framebuffer textures.
- <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move backward through the framebuffer textures.
