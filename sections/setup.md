# 3D Game Shaders For Beginners

## Setup

Below is the setup used to develop and test the example code.

### Environment

The example code was developed and tested using the following environment.

- Linux manjaro 4.9.135-1-MANJARO
- OpenGL renderer string: GeForce GTX 970/PCIe/SSE2
- OpenGL version string: 4.6.0 NVIDIA 410.73
- g++ (GCC) 8.2.1 20180831
- Panda3D 1.10.1-1

### Materials

Each [Blender](https://blender.org) material used to build `mill-scene.egg` has two textures.
The first texture is the normal map and the second is the diffuse map.
If an object uses its vertex normals, a "flat blue" normal map is used.
By having the same maps in the same positions for all models,
the shaders can be generalized, reducing the need to duplicate code.

Here is a flat normal map which only contains the `(red = 128, green = 128, blue = 255)` color.
This color represents a unit (length one) normal pointing in the positive z-axis `(0, 0, 1)`.

```c
(0, 0, 1) =
  ( round((0 * 0.5 + 0.5) * 255)
  , round((0 * 0.5 + 0.5) * 255)
  , round((1 * 0.5 + 0.5) * 255)
  ) =
    (128, 128, 255) =
      ( round(128 / 255 * 2 - 1)
      , round(128 / 255 * 2 - 1)
      , round(255 / 255 * 2 - 1)
      ) =
        (0, 0, 1)
```

Here you see the unit normal `(0, 0, 1)`
converted to flat blue `(128, 128, 255)`
and flat blue converted to the unit normal.

You'll learn more about this in the [Normal Mapping](normal-mapping.md) technique.

### Panda3D

The example code uses
[Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/)
as the glue between the shaders.
This has no real influence over the techniques below,
meaning you'll be able to take what you learn here and apply it to your stack or game engine of choice.
Panda3D does provide some conveniences.
I have pointed these out so you can either find an equivalent convenience provided by your stack or
replicate it yourself, if your stack doesn't provide something equivalent.

Three Panda3D configurations were changed for the purposes of the demo program.
You can find these in [../demo/config.prc](config.prc).
The configurations changed were
`gl-coordinate-system default`,
`textures-power-2 down`, and
`textures-auto-power-2 1`.
Refer to the
[Panda3D configuration](http://www.panda3d.org/manual/?title=Configuring_Panda3D)
page in the manual for more details.

Panda3D defaults to a z-up, right-handed coordinate system while OpenGL uses a y-up, right-handed system.
`gl-coordinate-system default` keeps you from having to translate between the two inside your shaders.
`textures-auto-power-2 1` allows us to use texture sizes that are not a power of two if the system supports it.
This comes in handy when doing SSAO and other screen/window sized related techniques since the screen/window size
is usually not a power of two.
`textures-power-2 down` downsizes our textures to a power of two if the system only supports texture sizes being a power of two.
